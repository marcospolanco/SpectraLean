# Execution plan

This is the compact, current-state ledger for sustained autonomous work. It is
updated at milestone boundaries; [`AGENT_ACTIVITY.md`](AGENT_ACTIVITY.md)
holds the append-only narrative.

## Active milestone

**Citation hygiene and broad-SGT reorientation.** The projector algebra is
proved in the center. The persistence package is retained as an existing
compatibility/example result, not a roadmap goal. The citation-hygiene
audit items below were completed on 2026-08-17 (see Last verified state):

1. **False provenance note (found by audit):** the Chung index claimed
   earlier revisions recorded page-level locators "Theorem 2.1 p. 42,
   Theorem 2.2 p. 44". Git history contradicted this: the initial commit
   cited only "Theorem 2.2" without a page, and no pre-rebuild index file
   exists. The note now records the accurate history; theorem and page
   numbering stay explicitly unconfirmed against the printed text (no
   local copy; page numbers were not invented).
2. **Weyl citation fidelity:** `weyl_inequality`'s doc now records that
   its Lean form is the spectral-norm corollary of the cited general Weyl
   inequality (obtained by combining the additive bound with
   `λ₁(E) ≤ ‖E‖` and `λₙ(E) ≥ -‖E‖`).
3. **Davis–Kahan hypothesis tightening:** the separation hypothesis is
   now the binding single-pair two-cluster form
   `λ_{k+1}(A+E) - λ_k(A) ≥ δ` (the form used by the cited
   Yu–Wang–Samworth Theorem 2); the derived wrapper simplified to one
   Weyl fact at the gap index, and the QA reduces the pairwise form via
   `evals_sorted`.

**Hard-crust conversion (same module):** `spectral_gap_stability` is now
a theorem proved from `weyl_inequality` (Weyl at both gap endpoints plus
arithmetic), reducing the explicit axiom count 19 → 18 with identical
statement shape (no consumer changes).

**Leverage delivered:** a false provenance claim removed from the
human-review surface; two axiom statements aligned with their sources;
the mushy center shrunk at zero trust cost.

**Next action:** with citation hygiene closed, the next milestone is the
broad-SGT backlog (ready queue item 1) — **delivered on 2026-08-17**:
(a) `docs/6_SGT_BACKLOG.md`, the bounded center-first backlog ranked by
concrete reuse (random-walk/Markov interfaces; irregular normalized
adapters; expansion/cut interfaces; spectral algorithms; conditional
dynamics and statistical-mechanics items), each naming consumers and
dependency paths, linked from the README canonical-docs list; and (b) its
top-ranked item implemented: `Scaffold.Mathlib.GraphTheory.RandomWalk`
— `transitionMatrix`, proved row-stochasticity for `d`-regular graphs,
`randomWalkLaplacian`, and proved bridges to both existing worlds
(`= regularNormalizedLaplacian`; `= d⁻¹ • laplacian`). Pure hard crust,
no new axioms; QA `SpectralGraph/RandomWalk_QA.lean` with a concrete
two-vertex instantiation. Umbrella, scoreboard, and SGT index map
updated.

**Next milestone:** backlog item 2, remainder — the irregular walk form —
**delivered on 2026-08-17 (run 8)**. Evidence check first: the walk
Laplacian `I − D⁻¹A` is *not symmetric* for irregular graphs, so
Scaffold's `evals` does not apply to it, and the deferred eigenvalue
transfer would need a charpoly-roots interface absent from the pinned
Mathlib. Delivered in `GraphTheory.Normalized` (all proved): general
`walkTransitionMatrix` (`D⁻¹A`) with `walkTransitionMatrix_row_sum`
(row-stochasticity under positive degrees — the named Markov consumer),
`walkLaplacian`, and the similarity identity
`degreeSqrt_mul_walkLaplacian_mul_degreeInvSqrt`
(`√D · L_walk · (1/√D) = L_sym`), with the eigenvalue-list transfer
recorded as the precisely named residual gap in the backlog. QA extended
at the 3-vertex path (row distributions, walk entries `1/2`/`1`, and the
similarity identity instantiated entrywise).

**Next milestone (open):** backlog item 3 — expansion and cut interfaces
(edge-boundary and uniform-weight conductance variants), each admitted
only with a named algorithm consumer.

**Active slice (run 10, 2026-08-17): cut duality — delivered.** The
existing cut surface (`vol`, `boundary`, `conductance`,
`cheegerConstant`) had nonnegativity but not the duality facts that
every cut-consuming algorithm assumes. Delivered in
`GraphTheory.Spectral` (all proved, no axioms): `vol_compl`
(`vol S + vol Sᶜ = vol univ`), `boundary_compl` (`boundary S =
boundary Sᶜ` for symmetric `A`, via `Finset.sum_comm` + symmetry),
`conductance_compl` (`conductance S = conductance Sᶜ` — Cheeger
minimizer canonicalization; the sweep-cut consumer interface),
`boundary_empty`/`boundary_univ` (degenerate-cut guards). QA at the
3-vertex path (`SpectralGraph/Cuts_QA.lean`, 11 declarations):
singleton boundary computes to `1`, duality and conductance invariance
instantiate, volume complementarity totals `4`, guards evaluate.
Backlog item 3's "Have" list updated.

**Next slice (open):** remaining backlog item 3 variants — edge-boundary
and uniform-weight conductance — each to be admitted only with a named
algorithm consumer; or backlog item 4 gating review.

**Active milestone (run 1, 2026-08-17): SGT coverage radar (operator
direction) — delivered.** `docs/7_SGT_RADAR.md` published with both
radars scored strictly from repository evidence (every score cites
declarations with proved/admitted/absent status): subject — models 2.5,
spectral algebra 3.5, variational 2.5, cuts/expansion 2.5, walks 2.5,
electrical **0.5** (entirely absent), perturbation/randomness 3.0,
adjacent systems 1.0; assurance — proved depth 3.5, axiom minimization
3.5, Mathlib interop 3.5, QA 3.0, citation fidelity 3.5, downstream
reuse **2.5** (RandomWalk/Normalized unconsumed). Includes a
re-scoring protocol (scores move only with usable, verified coverage,
recorded with the causing milestone). Backlog gains the radar-driven
gated candidate (item 7, electrical structure) and a downstream-reuse
standing decision; README canonical-docs list links the radar. No Lean
changes; hygiene suite passes.

**Next milestone (radar-driven): first downstream consumer for the
walk/normalized interfaces — delivered (run 2, 2026-08-17).** New
`Scaffold.Mathlib.GraphTheory.Stationary` (imports `Normalized`; all
proved, no axioms): `mulVec_one_eq_deg` (`A *ᵥ 1 = deg`),
`normalizedLaplacian_mulVec_sqrtDeg_eq_zero` (kernel of `L_sym` is
`√deg` — the normalized counterpart of `laplacian_ones_in_kernel`),
and `walkTransitionMatrix_transpose_mulVec_deg` (`Pᵀ *ᵥ deg = deg`:
the degree measure is stationary for the walk, `π ∝ deg` — the named
Markov-mixing consumer interface). QA
`SpectralGraph/Stationary_QA.lean` (6 declarations) at the 3-vertex
path. Radar: downstream reuse re-scored 2.5 → 3.0 with this milestone
recorded (protocol followed); remaining reuse gap: `RandomWalk`'s
regular-case bridges.

**Next milestone (open):** a consumer for `RandomWalk`'s regular
bridges — **delivered (run 3, 2026-08-17).** Evidence-based scoping:
the λ-transfer consumer needs `evals (c • M) = c • evals M`, but
Mathlib's `eigenvalues` is `irreducible_def` behind the eigenspace
decomposition — recorded as a named backlog candidate rather than
attempted. Delivered instead: `GraphTheory.Stationary` extended with
the walk-Laplacian kernel facts —
`randomWalkLaplacian_mulVec_one_eq_zero` (regular; consumes
`RandomWalk.transitionMatrix_row_sum`) and
`walkLaplacian_mulVec_one_eq_zero` (irregular; consumes
`Normalized.walkTransitionMatrix_row_sum`) — conservation of mass,
`(I − P) *ᵥ 1 = 0`, the base statement of diffusion/mixing arguments.
`Stationary` is now the demonstrated consumer of *both* interface
modules. QA at the regular edge and the irregular path. Radar: reuse
re-scored 3.0 → 3.5 (recorded); the constraint is now breadth of
reuse, and QA (3.0, degenerate-case skew) is the weakest assurance
axis.

**Next milestone (superseded — QA lever delivered below):** breadth
consumers for the walk/normalized interfaces (second consuming module —
e.g. variational Rayleigh bounds through the congruence bridge), or the
QA-assurance lever (property-based/falsification QA — delivered as the
run 1 slice below), or remaining backlog item 3 variants with named
consumers.

**Active slice (run 1, 2026-08-17): exhaustive/falsification QA for the
SGT center — delivered.** The QA axis was the weakest assurance axis
(3.0): existing QA instantiated theorems at one or two cuts and mostly
*applied* the general theorem (e.g. `path_boundary_compl_QA` rewrites
with `boundary_compl`), so a mis-defined `boundary`/`vol`/`conductance`
self-consistent with its own theorem family would not be caught.
Delivered `Scaffold/QA/SpectralGraph/Exhaustive_QA.lean` (87
declarations, hard crust, no axiom changes): (a) kernel-checked
exhaustive enumeration of **all** cuts of the 3-vertex path and the
4-cycle (`Finset.univ.powerset` equality by `decide` — `cuts3_eq`,
`cuts4_eq`), with `boundary`/`vol` values computed from the definitions
against hand-expected numbers; (b) duality recomposed from the
independently computed tables (`exh_boundary_duality_QA`,
`cyc_boundary_duality_QA`, `exh_vol_complementarity_QA`); (c) negative
witnesses — conductance separates adjacent-pair (`1/2`) from
opposite-pair (`1`) cuts on the cycle, Rayleigh separates `8/3` from
`0` on the path, and an asymmetric two-vertex weight shows
`boundary_compl`'s symmetry hypothesis is load-bearing (`2 ≠ 1`);
(d) walk row-stochasticity computed per row, independently of
`walkTransitionMatrix_row_sum`. Implementation note: `degreeMatrix`'s
diagonal conditional elaborates with a classical `Decidable` instance
(defined at generic `V`), so the Rayleigh checks compose the proved
Dirichlet identity and kernel theorem — the *values* are still fully
computed. Radar: QA re-scored 3.0 → 3.5 (recorded per protocol).

**Next milestone (delivered as the run 2 slice below):** breadth
consumers for the walk/normalized interfaces (second consuming module
— variational Rayleigh bounds through the congruence bridge). The
`evals (c • M) = c • evals M` Mathlib-excavation candidate and
backlog item 3 variants remain open.

**Active slice (run 2, 2026-08-17): variational transfer through the
congruence bridge — delivered.** The named breadth consumer from the
open milestone. Delivered
`Scaffold.Mathlib.GraphTheory.VariationalTransfer` (7 declarations,
all proved, no new axioms) plus QA
`SpectralGraph/VariationalTransfer_QA.lean` (15 declarations at the
3-vertex path): the generic congruence lemma
`quadForm (P M P) y = quadForm M (P *ᵥ y)` for symmetric `P`; the
Dirichlet-form transfer `yᵀ L y = (√D y)ᵀ L_sym (√D y)` consuming the
proved congruence; entrywise `√D *ᵥ y`; the degree-weighted
denominator `⬝(√D y, √D y) = ∑ deg i · y i²`; the headline
`rayleigh L_sym (√D y) = (yᵀ L y) / ∑ deg i · y i²` — the
irregular-graph normalized Rayleigh quotient the regular-only Cheeger
axioms cannot express; and `normalizedLaplacian_psd` transferred from
`laplacian_psd`. QA computes the classical value: at the path's
alternating vector, `8 / 4 = 2` — the largest eigenvalue of the
normalized path Laplacian, obtained without any spectral theorem.
`VariationalTransfer` is now the second consuming module of the
`Normalized`/`Spectral` interfaces (after `Stationary`). Radar:
downstream reuse 3.5 → 4.0, subject axis 3 (variational) 2.5 → 3.0,
both recorded per protocol. Umbrella and SGT index map updated.

**Next milestone (open):** the named `evals (c • M) = c • evals M`
Mathlib-excavation candidate (would connect `RandomWalk`'s regular
bridges to spectral statements); an irregular Cheeger statement shape
expressed through `rayleigh_normalizedLaplacian_degreeSqrt` (its
consumer interface is now available); or backlog item 3 variants with
named consumers.

**Decision milestone (run 9, 2026-08-17): `spectral_persistence`
deprecated — decision closed.** Consumer inventory (grep evidence): the
axiom had zero non-QA consumers — the derived layer mentioned it only in
a comment; its only use was the QA deliberately exercising the
compatibility surface; the derived two-endpoint chain
(`eventStreamProjectorDrift`/`davisKahanTwoPoint`) covers the motivating
persistence use. Per the architecture §9 lifecycle: `@[deprecated]` with
a migration note (probe-verified to apply to `axiom` declarations),
retained through the compatibility window — removal is a later release
decision, so the explicit axiom count remains 18 until then. The QA
exercises the deprecated surface with the linter silenced for that use
only. Indexes/docs updated (davis_kahan source, SGT/perturbation maps,
backlog standing decision, architecture debt, scoreboard). Bonus hygiene
in the same run: the derived module's use of Mathlib's deprecated
`div_lt_div_iff` upgraded to `div_lt_div_iff₀`; the full build now
carries zero deprecation warnings.

**Active milestone (run 1, 2026-08-18): Cheeger axiom statement-shape
repair — delivered.** Evidence found while scoping the
`evals (c • M)` candidate: both admitted Cheeger axioms state their
spectral side as `lambda2 (regularNormalizedLaplacian A d) …`, but
`lambda2` is defined as `evals (laplacian …) 1` — it wraps its argument
in the *combinatorial* Laplacian. The stated RHS was therefore the
second-smallest eigenvalue of `L(L_sym)`, not of `L_sym` itself; since
every `L_sym` row sums to zero, `L(L_sym) = -L_sym`, and on the
two-vertex edge the old lower-bound instance asserted `1²/2 ≤ 0` —
materially false. The docstring, index map, and source citation all
described the intended statement `φ²/2 ≤ λ₂(L_sym) ≤ 2φ`; only the
Lean RHS was defective. Delivered: new proved center interface
`secondEval` (second sorted eigenvalue of a symmetric matrix) plus the
bridge `lambda2_eq_secondEval`; both axioms restated with the corrected
RHS at unchanged names and hypotheses (emergency repair per
architecture §9); QA gains a **refutation of the old shape on the edge
graph** (`old_cheeger_lower_bound_refuted_QA`, via the new
`eigvalOf_le_of_quadForm_nonpos` Rayleigh bound and `cheegerConstant =
1`), an independent **value pinning of the corrected RHS**
(`edge_normLap_secondEval_eq_two_QA`: `λ₂(L_sym) = 2` on `K₂` from the
new `eigvalOf_sum_eq_trace` + `det_eq_prod_eigenvalues` +
sortedness), and `cheeger_bounds_edge_QA` instantiates the corrected
sandwich on the fixture. New center hard crust: `secondEval`,
`lambda2_eq_secondEval`, `evals_mem_eigvalOf`,
`eigvalOf_le_of_quadForm_nonpos`, `eigvalOf_sum_eq_trace`. This is the
first computational eigenvalue QA in the tree — the radar QA axis's
named residual gap (re-scored 3.5 → 4.0 per protocol). Axiom count
unchanged (18). Verification: `lake env lean` on both changed modules
(zero errors/warnings); all nineteen QA modules and the changed public
modules built directly; full `lake build` (2161 targets); all hygiene
scripts pass; scoreboard, radar, and both Cheeger indexes updated with
the correction record.

**Next milestone (open):** the `evals (c • M) = c • evals M`
Mathlib-excavation candidate (would connect `RandomWalk`'s regular
bridges to spectral statements — note the new trace/Rayleigh/membership
tools reduce its cost); an irregular Cheeger statement shape through
`rayleigh_normalizedLaplacian_degreeSqrt` (needs a precise source and
consumer); or backlog item 3 variants with named consumers.

**Active slice (run 1, 2026-08-18): electrical-crust step 1 —
connectivity and the kernel characterization — DELIVERED.** Operator
direction pinned `proposals/electrical-structure-crust.md` **step 1
only**: for a connected weighted graph, `ker (laplacian A)` is exactly
the constants — the converse of `laplacian_ones_in_kernel`
(`Spectral.lean`). Pure hard crust; **no new axioms** (count unchanged
at 18). Proposal steps 2–5 (effective resistance, Rayleigh
monotonicity, Foster) were NOT started — stopping here with a clean
proof is the successful outcome.

**Connectivity predicate decision (recorded before stating anything):**
adopted Mathlib's `SimpleGraph.Connected` through a `WAdj → SimpleGraph`
adapter `supportGraph A hA` with `Adj i j ↔ i ≠ j ∧ 0 < A i j`. The
`i ≠ j` conjunct is forced by `SimpleGraph` looplessness — positive
diagonal weights (self-loops) cancel in `D − A` and so must not create
adjacency. Tradeoff vs a native reachability inductive over `WAdj`: a
native predicate would duplicate Mathlib's `Walk`/`Reachable` machinery
with no consumer of the duplicate, and later proposal steps (component
structure, spanning trees) would need a bridge to Mathlib anyway. The
adapter reuses Mathlib's walk induction for the propagation argument,
takes the anchor vertex from `Connected`'s bundled `Nonempty` field
(discharging the empty-vertex-type case for free), and is the first
`WAdj → SimpleGraph` bridge — movement on the radar's standing
matrix-first interop deviation and the prerequisite shape for the
proposal's second recommendation (`SimpleGraph.toWAdj`). Cost: two new
Mathlib imports in `Spectral.lean` (`Combinatorics.SimpleGraph.Path`
for `Walk`/`Reachable`/`Connected`, `LinearAlgebra.Matrix.ToLin` for
`mulVecLin`), mitigated by the `supportGraph_adj` interface lemma
(`Iff.rfl`).

**Delivered statements** (all proved, in `GraphTheory.Spectral`):
`supportGraph` + `supportGraph_adj`; edge constancy
`eq_of_laplacian_mulVec_eq_zero_of_pos_weight` (zero Dirichlet energy
kills `(f i − f j)²` termwise on positive weights, via
`laplacian_quadForm` + nonneg weights); walk propagation
`eq_of_supportGraph_walk` (induction on `SimpleGraph.Walk`);
connected ⇒ kernel ⊆ constants
`exists_const_of_laplacian_mulVec_eq_zero`; `laplacian_mulVec_const`;
the iff `laplacian_mulVec_eq_zero_iff_exists_const`; the algebraic
headline `laplacian_kernel_eq_span_onesVec`
(`LinearMap.ker (Matrix.mulVecLin (laplacian A)) = span ℝ {onesVec}`).
QA `SpectralGraph/Connectivity_QA.lean` (15 declarations): connected
positive witness (3-vertex path — support graph connected by explicit
walks through the center, both iff directions, constant recovered and
pinned to its value, non-constant `![1,0,0]` computed out of the
kernel) plus a disconnected negative witness (two disjoint `Fin 4`
edges — component indicator `![1,1,0,0]` computed into the kernel yet
not constant, support graph proved not connected via a block invariant
over walks), showing the connectivity hypothesis is load-bearing.
Radar re-scored per protocol with this milestone (proof + QA landed):
subject axis 6 (electrical) 0.5 → 1.0, subject axis 1 (models)
2.5 → 3.0, assurance Mathlib interop 3.5 → 4.0; QA axis text updated
to 255 declarations / 20 modules. Backlog item 7 records step 1
delivered with named consumers for step 2.

**Next milestone (open):** proposal step 2 — effective resistance by
the potential equation (`IsEffectiveResistance A u v r ↔ ∃ f,
laplacian A *ᵥ f = e u − e v ∧ f u − f v = r`), whose
well-definedness consumes `laplacian_kernel_eq_span_onesVec`; or the
still-open earlier candidates: the `evals (c • M) = c • evals M`
Mathlib-excavation, an irregular Cheeger statement shape through
`rayleigh_normalizedLaplacian_degreeSqrt` (needs a precise source and
consumer), or backlog item 3 variants with named consumers.

**Active slice (run 1, 2026-08-18): the `SimpleGraph → WAdj`
interoperability adapter — DELIVERED.** The proposal's re-sequenced
step 1 (its "highest compounding multiplier"), completing the
two-directional adapter surface begun with `supportGraph`. Delivered
`GraphTheory/SimpleGraphAdapter` (all proved, **no new axioms**, count
unchanged at 18): `SimpleGraph.toWAdj` (defined as Mathlib
`adjMatrix ℝ` — no parallel matrix to drift), `toWAdj_apply`,
`toWAdj_symm`, `toWAdj_nonneg`; agreement family `deg_toWAdj`,
`vol_toWAdj_eq_sum_degrees`, handshake
`vol_toWAdj_univ_eq_two_mul_card_edges` (from Mathlib's degree-sum
formula), headline `laplacian G.toWAdj = G.lapMatrix ℝ`,
`boundary_toWAdj_eq_sum_neighbors` /
`boundary_toWAdj_eq_sum_card_neighbors` (crossing-edge count, each
crossing edge counted once); neutral re-exports
`laplacian_toWAdj_mulVec_eq_zero_iff_reachable` and
`finrank_ker_laplacian_toWAdj`; roundtrip
`supportGraph_toWAdj_eq_self` and connected-`G` corollary
`laplacian_toWAdj_kernel_eq_span_ones` (the delivered span theorem
applied to Mathlib graphs). QA
`SpectralGraph/SimpleGraphAdapter_QA.lean` (38 declarations): at the
3-vertex path, weights/degrees/Laplacian entries/both Laplacian
sides/boundary/handshake/kernel membership computed against
hand-expected numbers; disconnected `Fin 4` negative witness with the
component indicator computed *into* the kernel yet the kernel proved ≠
`span {onesVec}` (`twoEdge_kernel_ne_span_QA`) — connectivity is
load-bearing through the adapter. Umbrella, scoreboard (293 QA
declarations, 21 modules), SGT index map, backlog item 7, and radar
updated; radar re-scored per protocol after proof + QA landed: Mathlib
interop 4.0 → 4.5 (both directions, proved roundtrip, Mathlib
kernel/component results transferred), subject axis 1 (models)
3.0 → 3.5; README snapshot cell synced.

**Environment note (recorded):** the local `.lake/build` state was
found pruned at run start (Mathlib oleans down to 1795/5685, including
the modules this slice needs). The recorded interpreter-based cache
fetch (`lake env lean --run Cache/Main.lean get` from the mathlib
package) restored all 5685; `lake build` then recompiled the 2008
-target residue (~35 min) before the normal checks. Scoreboard
provenance note updated.

**Next milestone (open):** proposal step 3 — the kernel-equality
bridge `ker (laplacian A) = ker ((supportGraph A).lapMatrix ℝ)`,
inheriting Mathlib's `lapMatrix_ker_basis` and
`card_ConnectedComponent_eq_rank_ker_lapMatrix` for the *weighted*
Laplacian (the delivered `finrank_ker_laplacian_toWAdj` covers only
0/1 weights); then step 4 (potential solvability, the hinge — the
proposal forbids defining effective resistance before it). Or the
still-open earlier candidates: the `evals (c • M) = c • evals M`
Mathlib-excavation, an irregular Cheeger statement shape through
`rayleigh_normalizedLaplacian_degreeSqrt` (needs a precise source and
consumer), or backlog item 3 variants with named consumers.

## Ready queue

1. Citation hygiene — completed 2026-08-17 (see Active milestone and Last
   verified state); Chung provenance corrected, Weyl/Davis–Kahan fidelity
   notes added, DK hypothesis tightened, `spectral_gap_stability` proved
   from Weyl (axioms 19 → 18).
2. Establish the first broad-SGT backlog — delivered 2026-08-17 as
   `docs/6_SGT_BACKLOG.md` with its top item implemented
   (`GraphTheory.RandomWalk`); next backlog item: irregular normalized
   adapters.
3. Do not let retained applications or compatibility packages determine the
   next SGT milestone.
4. `spectral_persistence` retain-or-deprecate — decided 2026-08-17:
   deprecated with a migration note (zero non-QA consumers; derived
   chain covers the motivating use), retained through the compatibility
   window; removal is a later release decision. Do not extend its
   theorem family.
5. Re-admit removed subgaussian statements (moment growth, linear
   combinations, centering, sums) only when a consumer names them.

  (`vol_compl`, `boundary_compl`, `conductance_compl`,
  `boundary_empty`, `boundary_univ`); all hygiene scripts pass.
- 2026-08-17 (irregular walk form): `lake build` passes; 96 QA
  declarations, no `sorry`/`admit`; 18 explicit cited axioms (unchanged);
  general `walkTransitionMatrix` with row-stochasticity, `walkLaplacian`,
  and the similarity identity `√D · L_walk · (1/√D) = L_sym` proved;
  all hygiene scripts pass.
- 2026-08-17 (irregular normalized Laplacian): `lake build` passes with
  `GraphTheory.Normalized` in the umbrella; nineteen public modules and
  fifteen QA modules (93 declarations) compile directly with no
  `sorry`/`admit`; 18 explicit cited axioms (unchanged — pure hard
  crust); `lint_axioms`, `check_citations`, `check_markdown_links` all
  pass.
- 2026-08-17 (broad-SGT backlog + random-walk interfaces): `lake build`
  passes with `GraphTheory.RandomWalk` in the umbrella; eighteen public
  modules and fourteen QA modules (82 declarations) compile directly
  with no `sorry`/`admit`; 18 explicit cited axioms (unchanged — the
  increment is pure hard crust); `lint_axioms`, `check_citations`,
  `check_markdown_links` all pass; `docs/6_SGT_BACKLOG.md` published and
  linked.
- 2026-08-17 (citation hygiene + tightening): `lake build` passes;
  explicit axioms reduced 19 → 18 (`spectral_gap_stability` now proved
  from `weyl_inequality`); `davis_kahan_sin_theta` separation tightened
  to the single-pair two-cluster form (derived wrapper simplified to one
  Weyl fact; QA reduces the pairwise form via `evals_sorted`); Chung
  index provenance note corrected against git history; Weyl doc records
  the norm-corollary relation; `lint_axioms`, `check_citations`,
  `check_markdown_links` all pass; 75 QA declarations, no `sorry`/`admit`.
- 2026-08-17 (projector algebra): `lake build` passes; all seventeen
  public modules and all thirteen QA modules (75 declarations) compile
  directly with no `sorry`/`admit`; eigenbasis orthonormality
  (`eigvecOf_inner`) and completeness (`eigvecOf_complete`) proved from
  the Mathlib spectral-theorem API; `spectralProjector_idempotent`,
  `initialProjector_idempotent`, `spectralProjector_eq_zero`,
  `spectralProjector_eq_one` proved; new QA
  file `SpectralGraph/Projector_QA.lean` (5 declarations).

## Blockers

- The native Mathlib cache executable fails on this macOS environment with a
  dyld segment error. Cached artifacts were obtained through the recorded Lean
  interpreter workaround; this is environment debt, not an SGT source failure.
